# TTS-BentoML

Welcome to the **TTS-BentoML** repository! This repository provides a framework for deploying a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** application using **BentoML**, a powerful platform for serving AI models and applications. Follow this guide to clone, set up, and deploy the TTS service in the cloud.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To replicate this project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingabzpro/TTS-BentoML.git
```

Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd TTS-BentoML
```

### Deploying the TTS Service

#### Step 1: Install BentoML

Ensure you have BentoML installed on your system. If not, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install bentoml
```

For more details on BentoML, visit their [official GitHub page](https://github.com/bentoml).

#### Step 2: Login to BentoCloud

To deploy the application in the cloud, you need to log in to BentoCloud. BentoCloud is a fully-managed platform for running AI applications.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bentoml cloud login
```

This command will redirect you to create an account on BentoCloud and generate an API key. Follow the instructions to complete the login process.

#### Step 3: Deploy the Application

Once logged in, deploy your Text-to-Speech application using the following command:

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

This command will:

1. Push the necessary images to BentoCloud.
2. Build the environment using the images.
3. Download the TTS model.
4. Initialize the server to serve the application.

#### Step 4: Access Your Deployed Service

After deployment, BentoCloud will provide you with an endpoint URL to access your TTS service. You can use this endpoint to send text input and receive audio output.
